# Documentation

Start with the [recipes](recipes/) if you have a task in hand. This page is the
map of everything else.

## I want to …

## Reading order for a newcomer

1. [glossary.md](glossary.md) — the vocabulary, so the rest reads faster.
2. [concepts.md](concepts.md) — what a template package is and what this
   scaffold gives you.
3. [recipes/first-run-setup.md](recipes/first-run-setup.md) →
   [recipes/create-a-new-module.md](recipes/create-a-new-module.md) — the path
   from *Use this template* to a module that builds.
4. [workflows.md](workflows.md) — what CI will do to your pull requests.

## What is a recommendation and what is a rule

Almost everything here is **this template's** convention or a recommendation. It
is not MII policy: the MII's own published rules live in the KDS governance and
on the [MII website](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/), and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) says which of them apply to a module.

The exceptions — things that genuinely fail a build here — are stated as such in
[workflows.md](workflows.md).
