# self-check-substitute.sh — substitute the documented SELF-CHECK values into
# WORKSPACE copies of this template repository's build inputs, so the template
# repo's own CI can prove the pipeline builds.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SCRIPT
#   This repository ships {{PLACEHOLDER}} values so a module author starts from
#   a documented scaffold; it is therefore not buildable as-is. The substitution
#   used to live inline in .github/workflows/ig-publisher.yml. A SECOND build
#   workflow now needs exactly the same substitution — release-demo.yml, which
#   renders the demo the Pages landing page advertises. Two copies of an
#   80-line table is how the two builds silently drift apart, which is the
#   class of bug release-demo.yml exists to end. So the table lives here, once,
#   and both workflows call this script.
#
#   THE TEMPLATE REPO ONLY. In a module created from this template every
#   placeholder is already replaced, so both workflows gate the call on the
#   repository name and this script never runs there.
#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES
#   sushi-config.yaml, ig.ini and every build input under input/ — contents AND
#   file names (input/translations/de/ImplementationGuide-mii-ig-{{MODULE_SLUG}}.po
#   must be RENAMED as well as substituted, or the publisher silently ignores it
#   and German pages fall back to English titles). Nothing is ever committed:
#   the workflows do not push source.
#
# THE DEMO VERSION — SELF_CHECK_RELEASE_TAG
#   CALVER_VERSION is what the rendered demo displays as its version. Left to
#   its default it is a fixed draft value, which is right for a branch preview.
#   For a RELEASE demo that default is exactly the defect this script's caller
#   fixes: the published demo used to claim a version unrelated to the release
#   it was promoted for (demo/v0.5.2/ rendered "… v2026.0.0"). Set
#   SELF_CHECK_RELEASE_TAG=vX.Y.Z and CALVER_VERSION becomes
#   <CALVER_YEAR>.0.0-template.X.Y.Z — the MII CalVer shape the scaffold
#   teaches, carrying the template release it was built from, so the render
#   cannot claim a different one. release-demo.yml asserts the built
#   ImplementationGuide carries exactly this value.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/self-check-substitute.sh [--root <dir>]
#     --root   repository root to operate on (default: current directory)
#   env SELF_CHECK_RELEASE_TAG   optional release tag, e.g. v0.5.2
#
# Exit code: 0 on success; non-zero if any placeholder survives (see the guards
# at the end) or the arguments are wrong.
