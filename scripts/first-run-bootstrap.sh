#!/usr/bin/env bash
# first-run-bootstrap — one-time setup for a NEW MODULE created from this
# template repository via "Use this template". Run it ONCE, in your new module
# repository, right after creating it. See docs/recipes/first-run-setup.md for
# the click-by-click walkthrough.
#
# What it does:
#   (a) creates the `dev` integration branch from `main` and applies branch
#       protection to both (needs `gh` authenticated with admin on the repo);
#   (b) removes the template's own release automation, which must NOT live in a module
#       (the Release Please automation + the template's SemVer release
#       announcement + the template CHANGELOG), using a deterministic,
#       reversible `git rm` with a NEVER-protect list. This script and
#       docs/recipes/first-run-setup.md are NOT removed — they are on the NEVER
#       list, because a created module's docs link to both;
#   (c) prints a post-bootstrap checklist (placeholders, Pages, secrets).
#
# Safety model:
#   - DRY-RUN by default: shows the branch commands and the exact removal list,
#     changes nothing. Pass --apply to perform the changes.
#   - Removals go through `git rm` (staged, reversible with `git restore`),
#     never a bare delete of tracked files.
#   - A NEVER-protect list hard-aborts if any removal target ever collides with
#     module content, build input, or PROPAGATED tooling — a safety net
#     against an edited list.
#   - The whole body is wrapped in main() so the `local` declarations below are
#     scoped, and so bash has parsed the entire script before any removal runs.
# Bash 3.2 compatible (no mapfile/associative arrays).

  (no flags)        DRY-RUN: print what would happen, change nothing.
  --apply           perform the branch setup and the file removals.
  --main-reviews N   required approvals on main   (default 1).
  --dev-reviews N    required approvals on dev    (default 0, solo-friendly).
  -h, --help         show this help.

== Post-bootstrap checklist (do these by hand) ==

1. Replace every {{PLACEHOLDER}} in the scaffold. Start here and follow the
   comments — the module does NOT build until they are all replaced:
     - sushi-config.yaml   ({{MODULE_SLUG}}, {{MODULE_NAME}}, {{MODULE_TITLE}},
                            {{MODULE_DESCRIPTION}}, {{CALVER_VERSION}}, dates, …)
     - ig.ini              (the {{MODULE_SLUG}} in the ig path; LEAVE
                            `template = #ig-template` as it is until the MII
                            template package is published — see
                            docs/recipes/switch-template-to-published.md)
     - publication-request.json, .github/workflows/go-publish.yml
       ({{GITHUB_ORG}}, {{REPO_NAME}}, canonical, …)
     - qc/custom.rules.yaml, tests/, the pages and the FSH sources
   Run `node scripts/convention-check.mjs` — it must be green (parameterized
   fields are OK until you resolve them; a release branch requires them all set).

2. Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → "GitHub
   Actions". Then set the repository variable PAGES_ACTIONS_ENABLED=true only
   once that is done (the publication workflow checks it).

3. Terminology (optional): to build against the MII SU-TermServ, add the
   repository secrets SU_TERMSERV_CLIENT_CERT / SU_TERMSERV_CLIENT_KEY /
   SU_TERMSERV_CLIENT_PASSWORD. Without them the build falls back to the
   public HL7 server https://tx.fhir.org (it does not hard-fail).

4. Release announcements (optional): add ZULIP_API_KEY to announce your
   module's CalVer releases to the MII Zulip.

5. CI pipeline toggles are ON by default. To require CI as a merge gate, add the
   relevant checks (e.g. convention-check, the IG preview build) as required
   status checks under Settings → Branches once they have run once.

6. Verify the branch model: `main` (stable, default) and `dev` (integration)
   both exist and are protected. Open your first change as a PR into `dev`.
