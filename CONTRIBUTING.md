# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! This page explains the branching model, the commit
convention, and — important for this repository — the difference between
contributing **to this template** and working **in a module created from it**.

## Two layers: this template vs. your module

This template repository itself is maintained on a `main`/`dev` model and
released with **SemVer via Release Please on `main`**; a module **created from**
it is released only via the MII Module Release Workflow (**CalVer
`YYYY.n.n`**), and the first-run bootstrap removes the Release Please files
from the new module so the two release systems never mix. The rest of this page
describes contributing to **this template repository**; the full operational
model for both layers is in [`docs/workflows.md`](docs/workflows.md).

## Branching model

Two long-lived branches, short-lived working branches:

- **`main` — stable release branch.** Always in a released, buildable state;
  every commit on `main` corresponds to a released (or release-ready) version.
  Protected: no direct pushes, pull requests require one approval. `main` is
  the **default branch**, so it is what visitors and "Use this template" users
  see first.
  > **Why main is default:** novices should land on, and start from, the
  > stable state — not work-in-progress.
- **`dev` — integration branch, unstable.** Where reviewed changes accumulate
  between releases; may be temporarily broken. Protected: changes arrive only
  via pull request. CI preview builds run here.
  > **Branch state:** `main` and `dev` diverged in both directions once, because
  > some changes were merged straight into `main`. They were reconciled on
  > 2026-08-06 and now point at the same commit. See
  > [docs/project-status.md](docs/project-status.md#branch-state--main-and-dev-are-reconciled)
  > for the back-merge rule that keeps it that way.
- **`release/vYYYY.n.n` — release-preparation branches.** The `release/**`
  name arms the convention check's strict release mode (unresolved
  placeholders and the demonstration page fail there); see
  [docs/release.md](docs/release.md).
- **`feature/*`, `change/*`, `fix/*` — short-lived working branches.** Branched
  **off `dev`**, one focused change each, merged back into `dev` via PR, then
  deleted. Name them descriptively (`feature/add-terminology-page`,
  `fix/footer-contrast`).
  > **Why short-lived off dev:** long-running branches diverge and become
  > painful to merge; small branches keep review cheap and history legible.

gitGraph
  commit tag: "v0.1.0"
  branch dev
  checkout dev

  branch feature/add-page
  commit
  checkout dev
  merge feature/add-page
  commit
  checkout main
  merge dev tag: "v0.2.0"
```

> Reads as: work happens on short-lived `feature/*` off `dev`; `dev`
> integrates; `dev → main` is the release, tagged by Release Please on `main`.

### Flow — making one change

1. Branch `feature|change|fix/<topic>` off `dev`.
2. Commit using Conventional Commits (cheat-sheet below); open a PR
   **targeting `dev`**.
3. On green CI + review, **squash-merge** into `dev` (one clean Conventional
   Commit per change), delete the branch.
4. To release: open a **`dev` → `main` PR** (the release-candidate gate, a
   human-in-the-loop point). Merge it as a **merge commit, not a squash**, so
   the individual Conventional Commits reach `main`. Release automation then
   runs on `main`.
   > **Why a merge commit for dev → main:** Release Please builds the
   > changelog from the individual Conventional Commits on `main`. Squashing
   > `dev → main` would collapse the changelog to one line.

## Conventional Commits — cheat-sheet

Every commit message (and PR title, since PRs are squash-merged) follows
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
`<type>: <short description>` — for example `feat: add terminology page`.

| Type | Use for | Release effect (SemVer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feat` | A new capability | Minor bump |
| `fix` | A bug fix | Patch bump |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None |
| `chore` | Maintenance (configs, housekeeping) | None |
| `ci` | CI workflow changes | None |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change | None |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests | None |

Breaking change: add `!` after the type (`feat!: …`) and explain the break in
the commit body — this triggers a major bump.

> **Why Conventional Commits:** the release automation reads them to compute
> the next version and to write the changelog. A wrong type means a wrong
> version bump.

## Pull request expectations

- One focused change per PR; keep diffs reviewable.
- PRs target `dev`. `main` normally receives work only as the `dev → main`
  release merge (plus the Release Please release commits).
- **If something does have to go straight into `main`** — a fix that cannot wait
  for the next release — the change is not finished until `main` has been merged
  back into `dev`. Skipping the back-merge is what made the two branches diverge;
  see [docs/project-status.md](docs/project-status.md#branch-state--main-and-dev-are-reconciled).
- CI must be green before merge.
- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Working in a module created from this template

If you created a repository via "Use this template", you are working in a
**module**, not in this template. The same branching model applies there
(after the first-run bootstrap creates `dev` — see the README's Quickstart
warning), but the release process is the **MII CalVer Module Release
Workflow**, not Release Please. The module recipes are in
[`docs/recipes/`](docs/recipes/README.md); improvements to the scaffold itself
belong here, as PRs to this repository.

## How this relates to the MII process

Everything above is **this repository's** workflow. It is not an MII rule, and
this repository does not speak for the MII.

The MII does publish rules for commenting on a Kerndatensatz module, and a
module built from this scaffold will eventually sit inside them. They are in
the [**KDS governance, version 4.0 (7 May 2026)**](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/sites/default/files/2026-07/KDS-Governance-v4.pdf),
adopted by the National Steering Committee and linked from the
[MII core-data-set page](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/medical-informatics-initiatives-core-data-set):

- **Where comments go.** After FHIR profiling, a module runs a commenting round.
  Comments are filed either through the HL7 Deutschland ballot portal **or as an
  issue in the module's own GitHub repository** (§5.1.2) — so a module's issue
  tracker is a sanctioned channel, not an informal one.
- **Who may comment, and for how long.** Anyone may comment; the round is
  announced in advance and runs for a defined window (§3.5.4). Voting on an HL7
  ballot is a separate matter and is restricted to HL7 Deutschland members.
- **The module team must answer.** Every comment is answered — accepted or
  rejected, with a reason (§3.5.4).
- **Comments are public by default.** A commenter may ask for their identity to
  be pseudonymised.

Two things the MII does **not** publish, which are worth knowing so you do not
go looking:

- **No code of conduct**, anywhere — see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **No `CONTRIBUTING.md` for a KDS module** — not in the reference module
  `kerndatensatz-basis`, not in any other `kerndatensatz-*` repository, and not
  as an organisation-level default. (A couple of the MII's *software* repos
  carry one; no core-data-set module does.) The one participation rule
  published organisation-wide is how to request GitHub access, on the
  [MII organisation profile](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md):
  email the Geschäftsstelle with the subject *"Zugang zum GitHub der MII"*.

> **Cite version 4.0, not what you may find first.** The
> `medizininformatik-initiative/kerndatensatz-governance` repository still
> announces version 3, ships no document and has not been touched since January
> 2024. Version 3.0's tooling chapter — GitHub, SharePoint, Simplifier, Zulip
> access — was **removed** in 4.0 and replaced by an appendix marked *in
> Arbeit*, so those instructions are no longer published guidance.
