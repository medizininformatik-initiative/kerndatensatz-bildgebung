* #STATIC "a group of images at varying spatial locations at the same time"
* #DYNAMIC "a group of images at a set of spatial locations (e.g., slices) at varying time slices, with all spatial locations acquired at all time slices"
* #GATED "a group of images at the same spatial location, same starting and ending time, but acquired in different time slots of (possibly) different R-R intervals"
* #WHOLEBODY "same as STATIC, except covering multiple transverse fields of view (and therefore acquired at a different time)"
* #IMAGE "a tomographic image slice"
* #REPROJECTION "a projection image derived from forward projection through slices of tomographic images, using the algorithm defined in Reprojection Method (0054,1004)"
